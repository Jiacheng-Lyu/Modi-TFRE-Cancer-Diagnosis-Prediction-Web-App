# Modi-TFRE-Cancer-Diagnosis-Prediction-Web-App

This is a Medical Prediction App which can be used to diagnose cancer for patients.
Modi-TFRE is a tool built specifically for transcriptor factor (TF) enrichment. The preferred TFs were differed from cancer to cancer, which hence, could be used for cancer diagnosis by Machine Learning. 

## Predict Task Description
The models for four different cancers including lung adenocarcinoma, liver hepatocellular carcinoma, breast cancer, and cervical squamous cell carcinoma based on different sample types and data types were trained.
> This app is used to diagnose cancer for patients, the potential options provided as:
* Binary classification (Cancer or Healthy)
* Multiple classification (One of the above four cancers)

## Environment Requirement
The following package / library versions were used in this study:
* python (version 3.9.18)
* streamlit (version 1.28.2)
* numpy (version 1.26.0)
* scikit-learn (version 1.2.1)
* umap-learn (version 0.5.3)
* numba (version 0.58.1)

## Folders Structure
* *models*: which contains all the models for each of input features and each of prediction tasks.
