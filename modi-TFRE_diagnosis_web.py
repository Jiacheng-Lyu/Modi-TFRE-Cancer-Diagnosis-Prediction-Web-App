    Modi-TFRE is a tool built specifically for transcriptor factor (TF) enrichment
    The preferred TFs were differed from cancer to cancer, which hence, could be used for cancer diagnosis by Machine Learning. 
    The models for four different cancers including lung adenocarcinoma, liver hepatocellular carcinoma, breast cancer, and cervical squamous cell carcinoma based on different sample types and data types were trained
